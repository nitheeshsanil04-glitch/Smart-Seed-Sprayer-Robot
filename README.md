# Smart-Seed-Sprayer-Robot
Arduino-based seed sprayer robot that uses keypad input to follow a grid-based field pattern and dispense seeds automatically.
## Project Overview
The Smart Seed Sprayer Robot is an Arduino-based automation system designed for small-scale agricultural applications. The robot follows a grid-based movement pattern defined by user input and dispenses seeds at fixed intervals using a servo mechanism.
## Features
- Keypad-based input for field dimensions
- Grid-based movement logic
- DC motor control using motor driver
- Servo-controlled seed dispensing
- I2C LCD for real-time status display
